        <h1>Catan, 3D Print, Bluetooth beacons and LED project</h1>

        Hello, I am Anh and I like making cool stuff
      <p>
        I am currently working on a 3D printed Catan set, I plan to rig up the Tiles wirelessly with bluetooth so they can trigger LED lights when the physical accelerometer dice are rolled. I think dice roll is a fun aspect of a board game and it would be neat-o if we can toggle "fair mode" and "random" mode. All tiles will use diametric 3x6mm magnets. This is a log of my project; pretty much a Captain's Log. I think this project is cool because it introduces me to things I've never done before like soldering, firmware modifying. But it also takes things I am pretty good at like Painting, designing. I think painting is pretty relaxing and soothing.

        It's nice to be away from the computer and just concentrate visually, and just work with some dexterious skill and what might be a lost art. I think this project will take about 3 months, which I can always go back and keep adding layers and detail to the tiles. Painting in layers throughout the project would be cool if I can keep a neat log of all the progression pictures..
      <p>
        I print with an Ultimaker 2+ Extended.
        All pictures are taken with a Pixel 2 XL. They are mostly untouched, full-resolution 4k. Clicking the picture will allow you to see it at full resolution.
      <p>
        The Cura files are found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2525047">Here</a>
        I claim no fame on the beautiful craftsmanship that
        <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/Dakanzla/about">Dakanza</a> put together
      <p>
        I handpaint the tiles and this is now mostly my painting gallery (for now). I will keep logging this project including the tech, the code that I write, photos wiring/soldering the lights, working the BLEs, other rando stuff. I will also try to tidy up this site to a "real" site
      <p>
        My work is focused on Bluetooth Low Energy beacon solutions; so I an amazing opportunity to utilize the technology to do this little project while still using some old skills and improving them. It's a pretty good harmony.

      <p>Ideally the tile setup (underneath the printed and painted tiles) will look like this

      <p>
        Here's the <a href="https://github.com/AT89/Beacons-of-Catan">Github repo</a>. This is largely where I brainstorm/design the technical aspects.

                  Look at the detail on the desert, the grooves/lines creating texture. The cactuses look so great too!

                <p>
                  Base coat was done. I did not have "desert" color paint so I just used a mix of Metallic Red and Brown
                </p>
                <p>
                  Top Coat Matte will help dull out the colors so it does not look metallic
                </p>
                <p>
                  I plan to top coat everything all-together

                  I applied weathering here using the Tamiya Weathering kits.
                  I think the weathering kits are awesome, really brings out the detail for all the grooves and lines in your model

                  I was super excited about the details at the barn and the Sheep/Wheat at in-front of the barn</p>

                  Here's Lumber printing, you can see the stringy artifacts.</p>
                <p>
                  I plucked out these artifacts
                </p>

                <p>Fast forward... these were my steps</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Remove artifacts using a X-acto Knife and Tweezers
                  <li>Wash in soap and water, 5% 95% respectively
                  <li>Prime with White and let it dry for a day. Priming helps the plastic adhere to the paint.
                  <li>Paint with a base coat of <span style="color:green;">Green</span>
                  <li>Paint the tree trunks and stumps <span style="color:brown;">Brown</span>
                  <li>Paint the rocks <span style="color:grey">Grey</span>
                </ol>

                <img class="progress-pics"  src="assets/img/pp/Catan-13.jpg" alt="Catan pics"/>
                <p>
                  I applied a layer of lighter Green (Mixed Military green with white). I will go over this with the green to give it some texture
                </p>

                <img class="progress-pics"  src="assets/img/pp/Catan-14.jpg" alt="Catan pics"/>
                <p>
                  The Wheat tiles were a bit tricky, and funny. I started painting the base coat of these tiles as Brown but later I decided to do Light green.
                  Then I really couldn't recall what What fields look like so I went to Google. After some thought, I wanted to keep the real color of the
                  similar to what the cards are. So I mixed some Brown and Yellow to get this darker yellow. Then I painted the wheat tops with yellow. It actually turned out pretty well because it gives the house a nice mini lawn and some grass growing around the trees. I later added on rocks and details to the houses and piles of wheat. Then I added some wheathering to get some detail on the "rise" or sides of the wheat fields.

                  This was before I went back and layered green on the lumber
                </p>
                <img class="progress-pics"  src="assets/img/pp/Catan-17.jpg" alt="Catan pics"/>
                <p>
                  I applied a base coat of <span style="color:grey;">Grey</span>. Painted the trunks <span style="color:brown;">Brown</span>.Then painted the trees <span style="color:green;">Green</span>.
                  I added a paint mask to the little cart so I could paint the wooden supports without geting paint on the cart.

                <p> The white didnt turn out so well, I think it was because there was another layer of paint below it and the brush itself was not great at painting and was better at detailing. I went over it a few more times later. Added some unique details to every house and silo top. I didn't want to add too much detail to distract players

                  Here is the Wheat tile, some extensive detail work here. (the rock was redone later..)
                  Used the Tamiya Weathering kit to add some Mud weathering to the high rises of the Wheat
                </p>
                <p>
                  I used the gunk oil wash technique on the Ore mountains. I actually kind of liked it when the mountains were black so I rubbed the oil out and then applied it again to get some texture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Added Gun-metal weathering to make it sparkly.
                  A good guide on gunk-oil wash is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avj5mkLrrVY" target="_blank">Here</a> This is really how Star Wars and other Sci-Fi movies quickly make set props for space battles. Quick steps below:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Plop some oil paint on some magazine paper. The plastic finish on magazine paper helps dry it out and get some of the sesame oil out. I let it sit like this for 24hrs
                    <li>You apply oil paint with a brush (that you don't care about), dry brushing is the best for this
                    <li>Wipe area down using a microfiber cloth, use your fingers to gently rub some oil off. Apply more pressure/rubbing runs to get more oil out. It's really easy to re-apply since Oil takes a week to dry
                    <li>Wait a week and then Top Coat to seal it in
                  </ol>
                <p>
                  You can see my Gunk Oil wash finish on the

                <p>
                  Added some color to the cart, you can see the Oil paint effecting the wood, it looks great. I also splashed some oil paint on the trees and cleared it off to give it some coloring/shading as well
                </p>
                <p>
                  I later decide to paint it to brown anyway haha. I may later decide to try to paint it black.

                  I probably want to fix the weathering on the Wheat. at least on the top portions. I probably need to go over it again or wipe it down take off the weathering.

                  Starting 5 waters tiles. This blue Filament is amazing. I use Argos 3mm. A roll is $22 on Amazon. To print all these tiles on white.. barely took a good amount of the roll of white filament. Off the top of my head, a roll of filament would probably last for 4 Catan sets.

                  After letting the white Primer dry, I mixed orange and brown together to get this nice dark orange color, used that as my base coat. I went over again with this colo and took more brown. Then I went around the edges with brown. After that I touched up on the intersections of the brown and orange with another layer of orange-brown mix, that was a little darker. This allowed it to have a pretty nice blend. Then I proceeded to paint the tree's bark and then the tree tops. Next up would probably be to touch up the Stone hut (grey I am thinking? or some white grey brown mix), the rocks, mountain texture to look like Clay mountains and the little clay bricks

                  These are my bluetooth chips and receivers. I don't think I will use both but I would enjoy playing around with them anyway. The left chip is the nRF8001 which is a Bluetooth receiver and transmitter. This is my ideal chip. The one on the right is a Circuit playground to test/mess around with. I got these chips from <a href ="https://www.adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a>.These would go under the hex tiles when I place the tiles inside the border with the magnets (to be printed). LED lights should be arriving, I ordered 6 LEDs per tile. Upon further thinking, I will probably need to use the Adafruit Featherchip but its sold out at the moment so I will practice/mess with the NRF. I have a Gunpla LED idea I'd like to do with it anyway

                  First, tried to mimic the rock segregation on the mountain. That mightve been a bust. I had a nice brown/orange mix with a red tint on top. That looked nice too. I think I can keep trying to work on the color separation after revisiting. There's about 5 colors in there: white, grey, gold, chrome silver, the metallic red, the orange/brown.
                  I added some grass to the mountain tops. I looked at some images and some had grass on top. Painted the rocks brown and went over the trees again with green. I am pretty happy with this outcome and will go back and details some more.

                </p>
                <p>I want to try to get the color separation down really well. I think i might go over it again with the orange-brown so i can cover up "too many spots". I might just scrap it and go back to my original orange-brown mix with a tint of metallic red. I also need to color the actual bricks and the hut. I think coloring the hut a tan would be cool.. or white/grey.

                    Starting the base color of Light Green for the Wool Tiles. Decided I want to keep the house white and masked it with tape. I was going to do this for all the sheep but that was tedious.

                    All tiles now. Need to wait for the rest of the water tiles to print before I start mixing paint and detailing the waves. I am still waiting for the LEDs to arrive to begin playing around with the chips. Still have to print out the hex border/containers and the number chits as well.

                    Starting the clear filament. I am waiting on dear Dakanzla to update the STL files with inserts for the LED lights (they all arrived btw) but I want to print the water tiles and test out the fit on the hex border tiles.
